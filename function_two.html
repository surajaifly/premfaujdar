        <script>
            //WHY functions:
            //1. When code is more that 50 lines, then break into function.
            //2. These functions must be re-usable or generic.
            //3. Increase the reusability and readability of code.

            //Sum of two number.
            var number1 = parseInt(prompt('Enter first Number'));
            var number2 = parseInt(prompt('Enter second Number'));
            
            document.write('Max number is' + findMax(number1, number2));

            number1 = parseInt(prompt('Enter first Number'));
            number2 = parseInt(prompt('Enter second Number'));

            document.write('Max number is' + findMax(number1, number2));
            

            function findMax(num1, num2){
                if(num1 > num2){
                    return num1;
                }else{
                    return num2;
                }
            }

            //Assignment:
            //1. Design a function that will accept two params and return its products.
            //2. Design a function that will accept a param and return its factoiral.
            //3. Design a function that will accept a pram and return either the numner is odd or even.
            //4. Design a function that will accept a pram and return either the numner is prime or non-prime.
            //5. Design a function that will accept 3 params and return the max from those numbers.
            //6. Design a function that will accept 3 params and return the min from those numbers.
            //7. Desgin a function that will accept 5 params and returns the max from those numbers.
